# =    1  Preparations  ========================================================

# To load and analyze GEO datasets we use a number of Bioconductor packages:


if (! require(Biobase, quietly=TRUE)) {
  if (! exists("biocLite")) {
    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  }
  biocLite("Biobase")
  library(Biobase)

# =    2  Loading a GEO Dataset  ===============================================

# The R code below is adapted from the GEO2R scripts produced by GEO for GSE3635
# for the experiment conducted in the BIN-EXPR-GEO unit

# Version info: R 3.2.3, Biobase 2.30.0, GEOquery 2.40.0, limma 3.26.8
# R scripts generated  Wed Jan 11 17:39:46 EST 2017


# Load series and platform data from GEO. The GEO server is a bit flakey and
# I have experienced outages over several hours. If the command below does
# not work for you, skip ahead to the fallback procedure.

GSE3635 <- getGEO("GSE3635", GSEMatrix =TRUE, getGPL=FALSE)
# Note: GEO2R scripts call the expression data set
#       "gset" throughout ... in this script I give
#       it the name "GSE3635" for clarity.

# Subset, if the data contains multiple experiments with different platforms
# since we should not be mixing data from different platforms. (That's
# unfortunately very hard to do correctly). The "platform" is the type of chip
# that was used, and what I selected online when this script was produced, so
# GEO2R knows about the correct platform ID. Technically, subsetting to just one
# platform is not necessary here because we _know_ that GSE3635 contains only
# data produced with the GPL1914 platform. But that's the way GEO2R scripts are
# setup be default since they have to be able to handle a variety of cases.

#TASK>   Study this plot. What does it tell you? Is there systematic, global
#TASK>   change in the values over time? Within a cycle? Over the course of the
#TASK>   experiment?

#I might have expected hT0, hT6 and hT12 to be more similar in counts compared with
#hT3 and hT9, but this was not the case. This means that really the total gene expression
#Isn't consistantly higher or lower at the start/end versus middle of the cell cycle.
#There does appear to be a separation of values around 1200 and around 1500, but this might
#not appear as significant over many experiments. From the boxplot, I suspect this variation
#is not well correlated will time, or within a cell cycle. When I plotted all time points, there
#still seemed to be a separation of values, however this still didn't seem to have much to
#do with time.



# ==   3.2  Grouped Samples  ===================================================

#  This is the GEO2R code that produces the histogram you saw on the NCBI
#  Website if you went through the BIN-EXPR-GEO unit.

#  Group names for all samples in a series
gsms <- "0123450123450" # Each digit identifies one of the 13 columns
sml <- c()
for (i in 1:nchar(gsms)) {
  sml[i] <- substr(gsms,i,i)
}

                                                # unit

# Set parameters and draw the plot. I changed this from the original GEO2R
# code which overwrote the global palette(). That's evil! Utility code
# should _never_ mess with global parameters!

# =    4  Row-wise Analysis: Expression Profiles  ==============================

# What we did above was column-wise analysis and it gave us an idea about how
# our experiments relate to each other. To analyze individual genes, we need to
# do row-wise analyis.

#TASK>  Try to answer the following questions:
#TASK>     Are all rows genes?
#No, there are also loading controls and other control rows (some are genes, but not yeast genes)
featureNames(GSE3635)[grep("^[^Y]", featureNames(GSE3635))]
#TASK>     What identifiers are being used?
#          (cf. https://sites.google.com/view/yeastgenome-help/community-help/nomenclature-conventions)
#Nuclear ORFs
#TASK>     Are all rows/genes unique?
#Yes
length(unique(featureNames(GSE3635))) == length(featureNames(GSE3635))
#TASK>     Are all yeast genes accounted for?
#No, for example RNA-coding genes and mitochondrial genes are not present.
nNonYeastNuclear <- length(featureNames(GSE3635)[grep("^[^Y]", featureNames(GSE3635))])
nYeastNuclear <- length(featureNames(GSE3635)[grep("^Y", featureNames(GSE3635))])
length(featureNames(GSE3635)) == nNonYeastNuclear + nYeastNuclear

#     These are crucially important questions but you can't answer the last
#     question  because you have no information other than the gene identifiers.
#     However, any biological interpretation relies absolutely on understanding
#     the semantics of the data. Merely manipulating abstract identifiers and
#     numbers, that would surely be Cargo Cult bioinformatics.

#     To answer these questions about the data semantics, I have provided the
#     file "SGD_features.tab" in the data directory of this project. I have
#     downloaded it from SGD
#     (http://www.yeastgenome.org/download-data/curation), for a description of
#     its contents see here:
file.show("./data/SGD_features.README.txt")
#     Note: the file as downloaded from SGD actually crashed RStudio due to an
#           unbalanced quotation mark which caused R to try and read the whole
#           of the subsequent file into a single string. This was caused by an
#           alias gene name (B"). I have removed this abomination
#           by editing the file. The version in the ./data directory can be
#           read without issues.

# Leets peek into the file:
readLines("./data/SGD_features.tab", n = 5)

# ==   4.1  Task - Read a table of features  ===================================

# This data file is rather typical of datasets that you will encounter "in the
# wild". To proceed, you need to write code to read it into an R-object. Develop
# the code in your script file according to the following specification:
#
#    -  read "./data/SGD_features.tab" into a data frame
#          called "SGD_features"
#    -  remove unneeded columns - keep the following information:
#         -   Primary SGDID
#         -   Feature type
#         -   Feature qualifier
#         -   Feature name - (the systematic name !)
#         -   Standard gene name
#         -   Description
#    -  give the data frame meaningful column names:
#    colnames(SGD_features) <- c("SGDID",
#                                "type",
#                                "qual",
#                                "sysName",
#                                "name",
#                                "description")
#
#    -  remove all rows that don't have a systematic name. (You'll have to check
#          what's in cells that don't have a systematic name)
#    -  check that the systematic names are unique (Hint: use the duplicated()
#          function.)
#    -  assign the systematic names as row names
#    -  confirm: are all rows of the expression data set represented in
#                  the feature table? Hint: use setdiff() to print all that
#                  are not.
#                  Example:  A <- c("duck", "crow", "gull", "tern")
#                            B <- c("gull", "rook", "tern", "kite", "myna")
#                            setdiff(A, B)
#                            setdiff(B, A)

#       If some of the features in the expression set are not listed in the
#       systematic names, you have to be aware of that, when you try to get
#       more information on them. I presume they are missing because revisions
#       of the yeast genome after these experiments were done showed that these
#       genes did not actually exist.

#    -  confirm: how many / which genes in the feature table do not
#                have expression data?

#  How should we handle rows/columns that are missing or not unique?

#TASK>  Also: are the gene names in the feature table upper case, or lower case?
#TASK>  Also: note that the absolute values of change are quite different.
#TASK>  Also: note that some values may be outliers i.e. failed experiments.)

# =    5  Differential Expression  =============================================

# GEO2R discovers the top differentially expressed  expressed genes by
# using functions in the Bioconductor limma package.

# Package information:
#  library(help = limma)       # basic information
#  browseVignettes("limma")    # available vignettes
#  data(package = "limma")     # available datasets

# The GEO2R limma code is virtually uncommented, and has not been written for
# clarity, but for being easily produced by a code-generator that is triggered
# by the parameters on the GEO Web-site. Most of it is actually dispensable for
# our purposes.

# In principle, the code goes through three steps:
# 1. Prepare the data
# 2. Define groups that are to be contrasted to define "Differential"
# 3. Find genes whose expression levels are significantly different across
#     the groups
# 4. Format results.

# We are recapitulating the experiment in which we assigned the 0, 10, 60 and
# 70 minute samples to one group, the 30, 40, 90 and 100 minute samples to
# another group, and calculated differential expression values between these
# two groups.

setA <- c(1, 2, 7, 8)    # columns for set A
setB <- c(4, 5, 10, 11)  # columns for set B

# We remove columns we don't need, and for simplicity put the experiments for
# group A in the first four columns, and the group B in the next four.

# Our guess that we might discover interesting genes be selecting groups A and B
# like we did was not bad. But limma knows nothing about the biology and though
# the expression profiles look good, there is no guarantee that these are the
# most biologically relevant genes. Significantly different in expression
# according to the groups we define is not necessarily the same as a cyclically
# varying gene, nor does it necessarily find the genes whose expression levels
# are _most_ different, i.e. if the variance of a highly, differentially
# expressed gene within a group is large, it may not be very significant. Also,
# we are not exploiting the fact that these values are time series.
# Nevertheless, we find genes for which we see a change in expression levels
# along two cell-cycles.

# Let's superimpose some "real" cell-cycle genes:
myControls <- c("Cdc14", "Mbp1", "Swi6", "Swi4", "Whi5", "Cln1", "Cln2", "Cln3")

# Indeed, the discovered gene profiles look much "cleaner" than the real cycle
# genes and this just means that differential expression in the way that we
# have performed it is an approximation to the biology.

# =    6  Improving on Discovery by Differential Expression  ===================


# There are many ways to improve on purely statistical methods, if we have
# better ideas about the biology. I would just like to demonstrate one
# possibility here: calculate correlation values to a sample gene - such as Cln2
# for which we know that it is involved in the cell cycle. Let's plot it first:

gName <- "CLN2"
(iFeature <- which(SGD_features$name == gName))
(iExprs   <- which(featureNames(GSE3635) == SGD_features$sysName[iFeature]))
Cln2Profile <- exprs(GSE3635)[iExprs, ]
plot(seq(0, 120, by = 10),
     Cln2Profile,
     ylim = c(-1, 1),
     main = paste("Expression profile for", gName),
     xlab = "time (min)",
     ylab = "expression",
     type = "b",
     col= "maroon")
abline(h =  0, col = "#00000055")
abline(v = 60, col = "#00000055")

# Set up a vector of correlation values


myCorrelations <- numeric(nrow(exprs(GSE3635)))
names(myCorrelations) <- featureNames(GSE3635)
for (i in 1:length(myCorrelations)) {
  myCorrelations[i] <- cor(Cln2Profile, exprs(GSE3635)[i, ])
}

myTopC <- order(myCorrelations, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]  # top ten

# Number 1
(ID <- featureNames(GSE3635)[myTopC[1]])

# Get information
SGD_features[which(SGD_features$sysName == ID), ]
# Of course: the highest correlation is Cln1 itself. This is our positive
# control for the experiment.

# Let's plot the rest
for (i in 2:length(myTopC)) {
  ID <- featureNames(GSE3635)[myTopC[i]]
  points(seq(0, 120, by = 10),
       exprs(GSE3635)[ID, ],
       type = "b",
       col= "chartreuse")
  print(SGD_features[which(SGD_features$sysName == ID), c("name", "description")])
}

# Note that all of these genes are highly correlated with a known cell cycle
# gene, but because the absolute values of expression differences are not very
# large for some of them, they might not be picked up by any algorithm that is
# focussed on large differential expression changes. Do small relative changes
# mean small biological effects? Certainly not!

# And we haven't even looked at the anticorrelated genes yet...
myBottomC <- order(myCorrelations, decreasing = FALSE)[1:10]  # bottom ten
for (i in 1:length(myBottomC)) {
  ID <- featureNames(GSE3635)[myBottomC[i]]
  points(seq(0, 120, by = 10),
         exprs(GSE3635)[ID, ],
         type = "b",
         col= "coral")
  print(SGD_features[which(SGD_features$sysName == ID), c("name", "description")])
}
# ... which are very interesting in their own right.

# What I hope you appreciate from this example is:
#   -  convenient general purpose methods exist that analyze expression data
#        with sophisticated statistical methods;
#   -  the results of these methods depend on whether the statistics model
#        the biology well;
#   -  you will draw Cargo Cult conclusions if you can't cast your biology
#        of interest in terms of a model, "canned" solutions are unlikely
#        to give you all the answers you need;
#   -  being able to write your own code gives you the freedom to experiment
#        and explore. There is a learning curve - but the payoffs are
#        significant.

# =    7  Annotation data  =====================================================
#
# Loading feature data "by hand" as we've done above, is usually not necessary
# since GEO provides rich annotations in the GPL platform files, which are
# associated with its Gene Expression Sets files. In the code above,
# we used getGEO("GSE3635", GSEMatrix = TRUE, getGPL = FALSE), and the GPL
# annotations were not loaded. We could use getGPL = TRUE instead ...

GSE3635annot <- getGEO("GSE3635", GSEMatrix = TRUE, getGPL = TRUE)
GSE3635annot <- GSE3635annot[[1]]

# ... and the feature data is then available in the GSE3635@featureData@data
#     slot:
str(GSE3635annot@featureData@data)
GSE3635annot@featureData@data[ 1:20 , ]

# ... from where you can access the columns you need, e.g. spotIDs and gene
#     symbols:

myAnnot <- GSE3635annot@featureData@data[ , c("SPOT_ID", "Gene")]
str(myAnnot)

# ... Note that this is a data frame, but - oy veh - the gene symbols are
#     factors. Really, we need to fix this! To convert a factor into a string,
#     we need to cast it to character.

myAnnot$Gene <- as.character(myAnnot$Gene)

# ... whereupon we can find things we might be looking for ...
myAnnot[which(myAnnot$Gene == "MBP1"), ]

# ... or identify rows that might give us trouble, such as probes that
#     hybridize to more than one gene.


# Alternatively, we could have identified the GPL file for this set:
GSE3635@annotation   # "GPL1914"

# ... and downloaded it directly from NCBI:
GPL1914 <- getGEO("GPL1914")
str(GPL1914)

# ... from which we can get the data - which is however NOT necessarily

# matched to the rows of our expression dataset. Note that here to: the majority
# of data elements are factors and will likely have to be converted before
# use.
